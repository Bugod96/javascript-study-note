PassportJS
- an authentication middleware
- Strategy : an authentication mechanism
- Provider : an external website that will authenticate the user

- passport stores the sessions in Cookies

- cookies sent to the server on Every Request

- local strategy : username/password auth

serialization : a function where we can decide what information the cookie will have
deserialization : a function where we turn the cookie into an user object
- After deserialization, passport puts the user object in 'req.user'

If we don't use a CookieStore, the cookies will not be persistent.
- ex) 서버가 죽으면 쿠키들 전부 리셋됨.
